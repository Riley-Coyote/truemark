# TrueMark continuation notes

Read this before asking Mason to explain the project again. Maintain a concise record of project decisions and the next useful action, with dates and sources. Do not store credentials, private customer records or unrelated personal conversation here.

## Current handoff checkpoint — 16 October 2026

Source: Riley's instructions and local work with Codex; not a completed first session on Mason's computer.

- Mason is the client/product decision-maker and will work directly with Codex. Riley is not a required technical intermediary or release approver. Read [Working with Mason](WORKING_WITH_MASON.md) for the collaboration approach.
- Riley reports Mason has **accepted both GitHub and Supabase invitations**. GitHub contributor access comes first; ownership transfer is deferred. Effective permissions, authenticated Codex connections, local setup and the TrueMark application owner login have not been tested on Mason's machine.
- The source accompanying this handoff includes the shipping correction, Command Center lab and owner instructions. The shipping follow-up describes local implementation evidence, not hosted deployment. Verify the checkout version before presenting changes as available; an older clone or ZIP may predate this delivery.
- Shipping corrections have passed local checks: label receipt is separate from shipment; packing confirmation and queue behavior are improved; Review Moderation is removed. See [verification and remaining carrier work](../platform/SHIPPING-WORKFLOW-UPDATE.md).
- Larger remaining work: receive/release stock with certificates; sequential lot quantities and split-lot orders; unified communications and permissions; financial actuals versus inventory scenarios; then retention and the client's specific risk/forecast changes. See [current state](CURRENT_STATE.md) and the [implementation plan](../platform/COMMAND-CENTER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md).

## Source publication checkpoint — 16 October 2026

Riley requested publication of the current source and handoff to the existing GitHub repository. This delivery includes the application/shipping correction, the editable Command Center lab, owner instructions, plain-language collaboration guide, continuation notes, project-scoped Supabase connection configuration, and portable setup checks. Root `AGENTS.md` and README lead here. Use Git history for the publication commit identity.

The public checkout passed 35 targeted shipping/business tests, 29 portable routing/security/release tests, preview/live/launch builds, all seven local SQL validators, all five function bundles, and the browser artifact scan. Handoff links and staged credential/machine-path checks passed. The new shipping migration uses unique version `20261016000200`; the setup check now rejects duplicate versions. Existing Pages workflow and Studio release pin are preserved.

This is source publication only. It does not apply the new migration, deploy functions, activate real providers, or update the compiled Studio. Original design archives, editable Studio and optional Ghost source remain separate delivery items in ACCESS.md. Do not mistake a pre-publication ZIP or an older checkout for this source.

## Next useful session

Follow Mason's current request. If he is starting without a specific task, verify the delivered checkout and access, open the sample preview, then walk through one stock/packing example. Recommend receiving and lot allocation as the next substantial workflow. Ask how he chooses between two eligible lots before implementing their ordering rule; ask for real lot quantities only when reconciling stock. Do not open with every unresolved question.

Codex can independently inspect the lot model, trace its order/payment/certificate consumers, and research real carrier events while waiting for business details. No production migration, provider activation or customer communication is authorized merely by this checkpoint.

## Record future checkpoints here

For each meaningful update, add a short dated entry with:

- **Decision and source:** what Mason explicitly chose, versus an assumption or engineering recommendation.
- **Result:** relevant files/commit and observable behavior; label local, connected test or deployed state.
- **Verification:** checks and observed outcome, with links to detailed evidence when useful.
- **Next:** one recommended action and the question, if any, it depends on.

Replace stale next-step guidance as work progresses; preserve the dated decision history. Do not record example wording from the collaboration guide as an answer from Mason.
